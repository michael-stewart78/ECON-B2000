LAB 8 SUMMARY: LOGIT AND PROBIT MODELS
Michael Stewart

================================================================================
PART 1: MODEL COMPARISON (OLS vs Logit vs Probit)
================================================================================

Estimated three models using identical variables from Lab 7:
Variables: educ_hs + educ_somecoll + educ_college + educ_advdeg + AGE

CONFUSION MATRICES (using cutoff = 0.0797):

OLS:
       0      1
  0  200998  12161
  1  178438  20678

Logit:
       0      1
  0  228202  14424
  1  151234  18415

Probit:
       0      1
  0  223521  14007
  1  155915  18832

FINDING: All three methods produce similar predictions. All education 
coefficients remain highly significant (p < 0.001) with negative signs, 
confirming that higher education reduces the probability of large age gaps.

================================================================================
PART 2: THRESHOLD ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Tested different classification cutoffs using logit model:

Cutoff = 0.05 (low threshold):
       0      1
  0   60084   2536
  1  319352  30303
Result: Many false positives (319,352), few false negatives (2,536)

Cutoff = 0.10 (higher threshold):
       0      1
  0  302756  21903
  1   76680  10936
Result: Fewer false positives (76,680), more false negatives (21,903)

FINDING: Higher cutoffs are more conservative but miss more true cases.

================================================================================
PART 3: TESTING NEW VARIABLES
================================================================================

Tested whether adding race and interracial status improves prediction:

Model 1 (Baseline): educ + age
AIC: 223,902

Model 2 (+ Race): educ + age + RACE  
AIC: 222,629
IMPROVEMENT: AIC dropped by 1,273 points

Model 3 (+ Interracial): educ + age + RACE + interracial
AIC: 222,048
IMPROVEMENT: AIC dropped by additional 581 points

FINDINGS:
- Race significantly improves model fit
- Interracial status also improves fit
- Both Black (coef: 0.584, p<0.001) and Asian/Pacific Islander (coef: 0.468, 
  p<0.001) women show higher likelihood of large age gaps
- Interracial coefficient: 0.401 (p<0.001), indicating interracial couples 
  more likely to have large age gaps

================================================================================
PART 4: EXOGENEITY AND CAUSALITY
================================================================================

LIKELY EXOGENOUS:
- Race: Determined at birth
- Education: Usually completed before marriage
- Age: Observable characteristic at time of relationship

POTENTIALLY ENDOGENOUS:
- Interracial status: Could be a choice influenced by unobserved preferences

================================================================================
PART 5: SUBGROUP ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Analyzed prediction accuracy across racial subgroups using Model 3:

RACE                             ACCURACY    SAMPLE SIZE
Black                            24.7%       19,252
Other Asian/Pacific Islander     26.0%       26,443
Other race                       33.2%       21,298
three races                      34.9%       1,844
American Indian/Alaska Native    35.5%       3,772
two races                        36.7%       34,537
Chinese                          40.7%       8,482
Japanese                         61.9%       2,037
White                            73.2%       294,610

MAJOR FINDING: The model exhibits severe performance disparities. It achieves 
73% accuracy for White women but only 25-26% for Black and Asian/Pacific 
Islander women.

This is potentially due to sample size imbalance: White women comprise 71% of dataset

================================================================================
PART 6: RACE-SPECIFIC MODELS
================================================================================

Estimated separate logit models for three racial groups to test whether patterns differ across groups  

ACCURACY COMPARISON:

White women:
- Combined model: 73.2%
- Race-specific model: 58.7%
- CHANGE: Decreased

Black women:
- Combined model: 24.7%
- Race-specific model: 61.5%
- CHANGE: More than doubled (149% increase)

Asian/Pacific Islander women:
- Combined model: 26.0%
- Race-specific model: 65.7%
- CHANGE: More than doubled (153% increase)

INTERPRETATION: Race-specific models dramatically improve prediction accuracy 
for minority groups.
This suggests the education-age-interracial relationships 
operate fundamentally differently across racial groups. For example: Maybe for White women having a college degree reduces age gap 
likelihood by a greater percentage than for Black or Asian women.

The combined model imposes White women's patterns on all groups, resulting in poor performance 
for minorities.

White women's accuracy decreased with race-specific model because the 
combined model was already optimized for them due to their 
dominance in the dataset.

================================================================================
FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. Logit and probit perform similarly to OLS, with the advantage of producing 
   interpretable probabilities
2. Classification threshold choice involves tradeoff between false positives 
   and false negatives
3. Race improves model fit substantially (AIC reduction of 1,273)
4. Interracial status adds additional predictive value (AIC reduction of 581)
5. Education, age, and race are likely exogenous; interracial status is likely endogenous
6. Model exhibits substantial algorithmic bias: 73% accuracy for White women 
   vs 25-26% for Black and Asian/Pacific Islander women
7. Race-specific models more than double accuracy for minority groups 
   (from 25-26% to 62-66%)
8. The improvement from race-specific models demonstrates that relationship 
   patterns differ fundamentally across racial groups
